On day 3 of our hackathon project, I focused on integrating the API and schemas provided by our teacher into the website. I started by thoroughly analyzing the API documentation to understand its endpoints, methods, and data structure. I then implemented efficient fetch calls to interact with the API, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. For the schemas, I incorporated them into the project using Sanity, customizing them to align with our project requirements.
