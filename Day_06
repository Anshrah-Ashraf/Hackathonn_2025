On day 6, I successfully deployed my website on Vercel, a platform known for its seamless deployment process. After finalizing my project, built using CSS, and TypeScript with a backend powered by Sanity and API integrations, I uploaded the code to a GitHub repository. From there, I connected the repository to Vercel, which automatically detected the framework and configured the deployment settings. Vercel's intuitive interface allowed me to manage the build process efficiently, and within minutes, my site was live with a dedicated URL.
