WORKFLOW OF MY WEBSITE:
 

DAY : 03 :
On day 3 of our hackathon project, I focused on integrating the API and schemas provided by our teacher into the website. I started by thoroughly analyzing the API documentation to understand its endpoints, methods, and data structure. I then implemented efficient fetch calls to interact with the API, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. For the schemas, I incorporated them into the project using Sanity, customizing them to align with our project requirements.

DAY : 06 :
On day 6, I successfully deployed my website on Vercel, a platform known for its seamless deployment process. After finalizing my project, built using CSS, and TypeScript with a backend powered by Sanity and API integrations, I uploaded the code to a GitHub repository. From there, I connected the repository to Vercel, which automatically detected the framework and configured the deployment settings. Vercel's intuitive interface allowed me to manage the build process efficiently, and within minutes, my site was live with a dedicated URL.
